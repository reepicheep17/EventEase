EventEase - An Online Event Management System

Overview :

EventEase is a comprehensive online event management system designed to simplify the process of organizing and managing events. It allows users to create, manage, and track events, along with handling participants and event details. The system is built using Java for the backend, HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Bootstrap for a responsive, modern user interface.

Technologies Used : 

Backend: Java (for handling server-side logic and event data management)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for creating a dynamic and interactive UI)

Styling: Bootstrap (for responsive and modern UI components)

Database: (Optional: MySQL, SQLite, or another database if required for data persistence)

Features : 

Event Creation: Easily create, update, and delete events.

Event Management: Manage event details such as time, location, description, and participants.

Participant Registration: Users can register for events and track their participation status.

Search & Filter: Find events by category, date, or location.

Calendar View: View events in a calendar layout for easy navigation.

User Authentication (optional): Register, log in, and manage user accounts.

Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly layout built using Bootstrap.

Project Setup :

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the Event Management System on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/event-management-system.git


2. Backend Setup (Java)
Prerequisites:

JDK 11 or higher

Apache Tomcat (for running a servlet-based application) or any Java-supported web server (if applicable)

IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or any Java IDE)

Steps:

Navigate to the backend folder in the project directory.

Open the project in your IDE.
Compile and run the Java application (make sure to configure the server if using one).

4. Frontend Setup (HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap)

Navigate to the frontend folder.
Open the HTML files in your preferred browser (the front-end files can be opened directly from your file system or hosted on a local server).
You can also run a simple local server using tools like Live Server in Visual Studio Code for automatic refreshes and development convenience.


6. Optional: Set Up Database (if used)
If your application relies on a database (e.g., MySQL or SQLite), make sure to:


Create a database and tables as specified in the database.sql or any provided SQL scripts.
Configure database connection details (username, password, database URL) in the application properties file (application.properties or similar).

5. Running the Project

Backend: Run the Java project from your IDE or compile and deploy it to your preferred server.
Frontend: Open the HTML files in your web browser or host them on a local server.
